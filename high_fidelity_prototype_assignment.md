# Assignment: First High Fidelity Prototype Development for Final Project

## Overview
This assignment requires you to develop and submit the first high fidelity prototype of your final project, 
focusing particularly on the interface aspect. This initial prototype will form the foundation of your final project and 
will be crucial for testing and refining your design based on user feedback.

## Objectives
- Develop a functional prototype of your final project with a focus on the user interface.
- Understand the process of implementation of prototypes based on design ideas. 

## Task Details

### Prototype Development
- Develop the first high fidelity prototype of your final project. Ensure that the prototype includes a user interface,
  regardless of whether it's a web, mobile, or desktop application.
- The prototype should reflect the core functionality of your final project, even if it's not fully featured.

### Interface Design
- Pay special attention to the design of the interface. It should be intuitive and user-friendly.
- Ensure that the design is aligned with the objectives of your project.

### Code Submission
- Submit the source code of your prototype. The code should be well-organized and commented for clarity.

### Interface Screenshot
- Include screenshots of your prototype's interface. This will provide a visual understanding of what you have developed.

### Feedback Plan
- Describe how you plan to obtain feedback from end users about your high-fidelity prototype.
- Outline the methods you will use to gather feedback (e.g., surveys, interviews, user testing sessions)
  and the type of information you aim to collect.

## Submission Requirements
- Source Code: Submit the complete source code of your prototype.
- Screenshots: Include screenshots of your prototype's interface.
- Feedback Plan: A written plan detailing how you will obtain and use user feedback.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality (40%): The prototype should be functional and demonstrate the key features of your project.
- Interface Design (30%): The interface should be well-designed, user-friendly, and appropriate for the project.
- Code Quality (20%): Code should be clean, well-organized, and commented.
- Feedback Plan (10%): The plan for user feedback should be clear, realistic, and show potential for meaningful insights.

  This assignment requires individual submissions. If you are part of a team, each member should submit the
  same completed assignment. It is permissible for team members to collaboratively divide the workload
  during the preparation of the assignment. Once the work is collectively completed, each member must then
  individually submit the identical final product for evaluation. This approach ensures both collaborative
  engagement and individual responsibility in the submission process.
