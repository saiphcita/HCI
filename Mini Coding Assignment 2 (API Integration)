#### Overview
In this assignment, you will get hands-on experience on working with an API which could help you to
provide interesting interactive experiences for your end-user. Your task is to create a simple "Hello World" 
application that utilizes the API to demonstrate a basic understanding of how to interact with the API.

#### Objectives
- Gain familiarity with using APIs
- Develop a basic application that calls the API to perform a simple task.
- Understand the process of integrating an external API into your code.

#### Task Details

1. API Selection
   - Choose a generative AI API for this task. This could be OpenAI's API, or any other API you plan to integrate into your project.
   - Ensure that you have access to the API, including any necessary keys or authentication methods.

2. Application Development
   - Develop a small application in a programming language of your choice that makes a call to the selected API.
   - Your application should send a simple request to the API and display the response.

3. "Hello World" Generative Task
   - Use the API to generate a creative "Hello World" message. This could be a short text that showcases the capabilities of the API.

4. Documentation
   - Document your code and the steps you took to integrate the API.
   - Include instructions on how to run your application and any necessary setup.

5. Reflection
   - Write a brief reflection on your experience. 
Discuss any challenges you faced, what you learned about generative AI, and how you might apply 
this knowledge in your future projects.

#### Submission Requirements
- Code Files: Submit all the code files used in your project.
- Documentation: Include a README file with instructions and your reflection.
- Format: Submit your files in a zip folder or provide a link to a GitHub repository.

#### Evaluation Criteria
-API Integration (40%): Successfully integrating and making calls to the chosen generative AI API.
- Functionality (30%): The application runs smoothly and performs the intended "Hello World" generative task.
- Code Quality and Documentation (10%): Clean, well-commented code and thorough documentation.
- Reflection (20%): Insightful reflection on the learning experience and potential applications.

#### Suggested APIs
- OpenAI API: https://openai.com/api/
- Hugging Face API: https://huggingface.co/inference-api
- Hugging Face Documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs
- Any other generative AI API you prefer.

Happy coding!
