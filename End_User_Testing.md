# Assignment: End User Testing and Feedback Collection for High Fidelity Technology

## Objective
This assignment engages students in practical user experience research. Students will test their 
high fidelity prototypes (technologies) with end users, obtain feedback, and understand the usability and 
effectiveness of their technology from the user's perspective.

## Assignment Description

### 1. Identifying End Users
Identify a group of end users who represent the target audience of your technology.

### 2. Testing Methodology
Some of themethods for testing your technology with end users could include:
   - Interviews: Conduct in-depth interviews with users before, during or after they use your technology.
   - Cognitive Walkthrough: Guide users through the technology, observing their interactions and reactions.
   - User Study: Design a structured study where users interact with the technology in a controlled environment.

### 4. Conducting the Test
Execute the chosen testing method, observing and noting user behavior, difficulties, and feedback.

### 5. Collecting Feedback
Gather all feedback, observations, and data from the testing phase.

### 6. Analysis and Reporting
Analyze the feedback and observations. Prepare a report that includes:
   - Description of the technology and the target user group.
   - Justification for the chosen testing methodology.
   - Summary of key findings from the user test.
   - Insights on usability and user experience.
   - Recommendations for improvement based on user feedback.

## Deliverables
- A shortreport detailing the testing process, analysis, and findings.
- (Optional) A presentation of your findings (this will help you for your final project)

## Assessment Criteria
- Quality and relevance of the chosen testing method.
- Depth and clarity of user feedback analysis.
- Effectiveness of the recommendations for improvement.
- Overall coherence and presentation of the report.

This assignment requires individual submissions. If you are part of a team, each member should 
submit the same completed assignment. It is permissible for team members to collaboratively divide 
the workload during the preparation of the assignment. Once the work is collectively completed, 
each member must then individually submit the identical final product for evaluation. 
This approach ensures both collaborative engagement and individual responsibility in the submission process.
