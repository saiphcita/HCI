# Assignment: Paper Prototype Development and User Feedback

## Overview
In this assignment, you will create a paper prototype of your final project design and engage with real end users
to gather feedback. Based on the feedback received, you will then refine and improve your design.
This process is essential for understanding user needs and ensuring your final product is user-friendly and effective.

## Objectives
- Develop a paper prototype for your final project.
- Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the prototype.
- Refine your design based on user feedback.

## Task Details

### Create a Paper Prototype
- Design a paper version of your final project. This should be a representation of your idea, focusing on the user 
interface and experience.
- Ensure that your prototype is detailed enough to convey your design concept clearly.

### User Testing
- Identify a group of end users who represent your target audience.
- Conduct user testing sessions where you present your paper prototype and observe users interacting with it.
- Gather feedback on various aspects of your design, such as usability, aesthetics, functionality, and overall user experience.

### Feedback Documentation
- Document the feedback received from each user testing session.
- Note both the positive aspects and the areas where users faced difficulties or offered suggestions.

### Design Improvement
- Analyze the feedback and identify common themes or issues.
- Redesign your paper prototype to incorporate this feedback and improve the overall design.
- Create a second version of your prototype reflecting these improvements.

### Reflection and Report
- Write a report detailing the process, your findings from the user testing, and the changes you made to your design.
- Reflect on how the user feedback influenced your design decisions and the challenges you faced during the process.

## Submission Requirements
- Paper Prototype: Submit photos or a digital scan of your original and improved paper prototypes.
- User Feedback Documentation: Provide a summary of the feedback received, mention how you recruited
your participants and what you asked them to do. 
- Design Improvement Documentation: Explain the changes made to the original design based on users' feedback.
- Reflection and Report: Submit a written report covering all aspects of the assignment.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Quality of Initial Prototype (25%): How well the initial prototype represents your project idea.
- Effectiveness of User Testing (25%): How well you conducted user testing and gathered feedback.
- Quality of Improved Design (25%): The effectiveness and creativity of your design improvements.
- Depth of Reflection and Report (25%): The thoroughness and insightfulness of your written report and reflection.

This assignment requires individual submissions. If you are part of a team, each member should submit the 
same completed assignment. It is permissible for team members to collaboratively 
divide the workload during the preparation of the assignment. Once the work is 
collectively completed, each member must then individually submit the identical final product for 
evaluation. This approach ensures both collaborative engagement and individual responsibility 
in the submission process.
